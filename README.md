# AIxDATAxFinal
My team and I's final submission for the AIxData Datathon where we won 1st place for the Supervised Learning Pillar. We were tasked with finding the Average disbursed loans based on a training and testing dataset. We developed a model that was comprised of an XGB model along with a random forest model. We preprocessed and cleaned our data and then combined both predictions from the models at the end to make our final calculation even stronger.
